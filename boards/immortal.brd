Gatz.. I was doing a little room prgram today and it kept crashing the mud.
But like, it's such a stupid simple program that I've done a thousand times,
I dunno why it's crashing now. See if you can find anything wrong with this.
 
rp add entry 100
if name(Lin)
mea $r Hi Lin.
else
mea $ Get out.
endif
 
 
That's a program I was planning on putting at some ships, on their bridges or
cockpits. Something like checking for the owner's ID and echoing something
if it's him, and echoing something else if it's not the owner.

ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME you put programs on ships. It is something I would have
done a long ass time ago if I were ship builder. Thank you for doing it.
 
BTW, the progs look really good as of now, just dont do anything incredibly stu
sorry, just dont do anything incredibly stupid
.
for instance,
if name($n) == yumi
mea $n hello yumi
else
mpforce $n leave
endif
 
that kind of stuff would sure SUCK ASS
all ships should be hijackable, but dont do anything stupid like that
that is all

here is a sample program for enhancing a ship with programs. its not
complete, just bare bones, you could add all sorts of things to it to make
it much better, but this is the general idea
 
 
also, you can subsitute names of course as needed
or change whatever
 
(duh)
 
i actually made a mob for this
feel free to invoke it
 
Name: Ships computer.  Vnum: 2618.
Short description: The ships computer.
Long  description: The ships computer is glowing with light from readouts.
Hp: 1000/1000.  Mana: 0/0.  Move: 1000/1000. 
Lv: 1.  Align: 0.  AC: 0.  Credits: 0.
>all_greet_prog 100
if name($n) == riku
mpecho Welcome to the Enterprise Riku
mpecho The captains chair swivels around to face you.
else
if mortinworld(riku)
mpgoto riku
whisper riku $n is on your ship.
mpgoto 2617
endif
endif
oh yeah, btw this mob is flagged as invis, just oinvoke 2649 and wear shades
if you want to see it

Gatz, you know how I said I would have my area done in a few days? I
LIED!!! It has turned out a little bit more complicated than I imagined it
would .  I will need at least a few more days if I really crank this shit
out. Take a look if you don't believe me.  Seriously. You know how mobs
can't check themselves for non static variables? Well, I figured out a way
that they can!...Sort of. By using a complicated system of supermobs that
control everything, I was able to do things like have the supermobs check
the mob for wulongs as a trigger/switch. When the mob had a certain amount
of wulongs, the supermob would force the mob to do things . Its rather
ingenious, and I am proud of my work.
 
Anyway, cya
