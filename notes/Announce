Subject Area Building Notes~
Text
Okay, some of you are new builders and others are just new
to SWR building. Here are a couple notes to keep in mind:
 
1) Dont use an object or mob from another area, make a
duplicate of it in your area, believe it or not doing that
save ALOT of memory and cpu time.
 
2) When you create an area as part of a planet, be sure to
set what planet that area belongs to. If you neglect to do
that then any dipomacy skills and other such things that
require the area be pointing to a planet will not work.
simply enter: aset <filename> planet <planetname>
This is why jefro wasnt able to gain smalltalk experience.
 
Thats it really, keep up the good building

Subject whats up~

Hey guys, okay i would like to give all of you a decent estimate
on when "GANADIA" goes live. I want to give a flexible time limit
of a week to a week and a half. If seen alot of you on lately.
I just haven't seen any productivity. Im not about to say you will
be mortalized if you dont finish your shite, but i would like it
if you builders can finish your areas up, so many of them are on
the verge of completion, also, from what i hear Danube's area needs
some work with progs and things like making items search for items.
Gaden, I've seen you playing around online, thats cool, and i know
you can code because i see you fuck with Jefro(Jayne) all the time.
I need you to give me a list on some stuff you want to change, or
if you want to be changed to a builder, ask me or scape and your
position will be changed. If you want to code and dont know what to
do, just ask me. I have a big todo list and i wouldnt mind the help.
We are on home stretch and the momentum was great at the beginning
so dont let it dwindle now, not when we are so close to making a
really great MUD. Now for some minor things, i need something from
each of you. Im gonna be making a skill tree called "Ancient Arts",
they will be imm only skills unless otherwise given to a mortal.
Make up a skill and send it to me, i need the Name,What it does,
What Planet did it originate from or what people did it originate
from (use your imaginations here). Last, not saying you have to
but if you could tell me what you need to finish your areas,
I might be able to get someone else to aid you in finishing it.
Jefro, thank you so much, your a great ginnea pi...i mean tester =)
Your help is detrimental to our success. Your job will not be done
after we go public however, you will need to help the new players
when we have them, with their questions. Well i appologize it was
so long, but i felt it all had to be said

Like nikon says, i need help finishing up my area, i need
someone whos able to make advanced programs. i can make
the basic items and such.
 
My mobs are very simplistic right now, im not sure how
to set specific flags on them etc etc. so I REALLY need
someone to help me finish it off
 
Please send me a gnote or if you want load my area and
work on it whenever u feel. its pretty close to being
finished, it just needs the touch up stuff.

Ok guys just to clarify, this is the reason i wrote the
note about wanting one on one time with everyone. I 
agree totally with nikon. We started off great then
BAM it was like a brick wall. Its ok tho. I just wanted
a sit in with everyone to discuss certain stuff and nikon
even wrapped it up tho LOL. And im not saying its everyone
or pointing fingers, I havent done too much building myself.
I keep getting bombarded with stuff that i need to address.
Its ok tho, i really wanna hear your opinions and what you think
and thats why i wanted a sit down with everyone.
