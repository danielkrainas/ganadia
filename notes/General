Subject Ship weapons~
Text
I found some bugs on ship weapons that need fixed bigtime.
 
First when you add a weapon it does add to slots and
payload but when you remweapon the slots and payload stays
the same.
Also there no way to replenish weapon ammo at all, maybe
a "reload" command would be cool.
 
Thats all of the bugs i can think of so far, but there could
be more, range is working great btw.
