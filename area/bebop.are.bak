Bebop's Lounge~
A few couches and an ancient TV set are the highlights of this room. There
is a wai-pai game board setting on a table along with a few of it's
tokens. There is a smell of dog crap coming from the direction of Faye's
favorite spot to sit.

A Storage Room~
The storage room is completely cluttered with all kinds of junk, strewn
over the walls and floor.  There isn't much sound in this room, besides a
small scratching noise coming from a glowing refridgerator at the farthest
corner of the storage place.  It appears as if something is living
there... shouldn't have forgotten about that lobster, Spike.

The Head~
This corner of the ship is where all the water oriented activities take
place.  (ie, Showers, Bathroom.)  Overuse of the water is discouraged, as
while in space, the Bebop only has a limited supply in its tanks.

The Isolation Chamber~
The Isolation Chamber is a dreary place.  There is a soft, diffuse light
and soft grey walls.  It would be almost relaxing if it weren't so mind-
numbingly boring.  If you have to stay in here much longer, you are sure
to lose your sanity.

There are several monitors and controls in front of 2 seats. The large,
thick windows here allow the Crew of BeBoP to see anything and everything.
There are several smaller windows along the walls with microphones set
alongside each one.

The Conference Room~
Within the conference room, the decor is rather gloomy, the lighting dim.
Everything is a dark stained cherry, the seat cushions on all of the
executive chairs covered in a deep brownish red leather.  The center table
at which all of the seats are gathered around is oval shaped, and has a
seat at each end, with ten seats on either side.  There is a file cabinet
at the far end of the room, and materials for drawing out treaties and
contracts laid out on the desk.
