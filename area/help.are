1 -PK- PK PKILL PKILLING~
The rules for Player Killing (PK) are very, very strict. Plainly  stated,
PK for no reason's punishment is deletion, with zero  changes. You DON'T
have a reason if it doesn't fit in the  following rules.
 
Reasons:
-In RP someone challenges you to a fight or taunts you 
into action. (If you taunt another player to fight, make 
sure you watch it because going too far is harassment.)
-Clan War, either clan who is directly in the war can
kill each other
-Holding EQ that doesn't belong to you. (This has the 
ability to be abused so in fore-sight make sure you 
can prove the EQ once belonged to you or your clan)
-Being in ISSP or RBH and hunting down a bounty.
-Defense from being attacked. (Being focused on is 
considered an aggressive act).
Rules:
-No spam killing. (Understand limits, no character 
should be bum rushed 5 times in a row.)
-No camping outside of hospitals after someone just
got killed.
-No bringing IC fights to OOC or visa versa.
-Killing AFK or Newbie players IS NOT ILLEGAL 
but is looked down upon.
 
In general, if you couldn't be able to quickly tell an Immortal 
why you killed someone, then do not engage in PK. It is 
better to not try to PK then mess up and get deleted on a 
whim! If an Immortal deletes you there are no 
reimbursements of any kind to you! Please enjoy PK and 
report any people breaking the aforementioned rules.
 
Rule Clarification:
(This section is to make some of the rules clearer)
-Disarm/Backstab/steal are agressive commands and in the same boat
as attacking a player, similar rules apply.
-Consider is purly used to 'size up' an opponent and is an
act of pre-aggrestion. You can be attacked for using consider on
someone.
- If your in a clan, and resign, you may be killed. But, if you join an
opposing clan, whom is at war with you, and you die during the war, 
this COUNTS as the kill for resigning.
- Paying someone to kill another person is legal.
- Attacking someone to defend/revenge an IC friend is legal.

Someone caught by RBH or ISSP can not revenge pk his captor himself.

1 A~
.                MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
                ---------------------------
The game divided into many rooms which are connected by various
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to 
       exhaustion.  If you type SLEEP or REST your movement points will
       slowly be replenished.  You must type STAND or WAKE before 
       walking again.
~

101 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
Warning!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must
be Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed to you, only Lesser+
can assign themselves nonproto areas.
 
See BESTOWAREA

107 ACUTE~
~

107 ACUTE AWARENESS~
Syntax : acute
 
Allows you to see hidden players in the room.
~

101 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

101 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

-1 ADVENTURE~
.
   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a powers-at-a-glance function, which displays only the powers
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <power/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its power/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
 
~

101 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.
 
Blind          Invisible    Detect_evil  Detect_invis  Detect_magic
Detect_hidden  **Hold**     Sanctuary    Faerie_fire   Infrared
Curse          **Flaming**  Poison       Protect       Paralysis
Sneak          Hide         Sleep        Charm         Flying
Pass_door      Floating     Truesight    Detect_traps  Scrying

~

101 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax:  allow <site>
Syntax:  ban   <site>
Syntax:  ban
Syntax:  ban <# of ban on ban list> level <level of char to ban and below>
 
BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.
 
BAN with no arguments returns an enumerated list of banned sites.
 
To set a specific level of character to ban from a site, use 'ban' to get
the list number of the banned site and then use 'ban level'.
Example:  ban 2 level 10
 
This will ban all characters level 10 and under from the second site on
the 'ban' list.
 
ALLOW <site> removes a site from the ban list.
 
The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

THANK YOU ------------ Jet Black
 
All Imms be on the lookout for Weapons!
Weapons value1 needs to be 0!
Weapons value2 needs to be changed aswell but smartly.
Knifes and small weapons value2 should be 1-2.
Guns should be 4-5, and that is basics.


Make sure to check people who have the RP flag and watch them for a few.
If they are RPing award them QP, if not tell them to remove their RP flags.
If they consistantly don't use their RP flag right, right a comment to their
pfile so they won't recieve any more QP.
If you give them QP, record the data in help qpreward!

~

1 ARM~
.
Syntax : Arm (device)
 
You use this command to arm grenades, and the like.  You have to
be holding the device first, though, as unfortunately, only ISSP has
remotely-controlled grenade armers.  Too bad.  Also, be sure to drop
the device after you've armed it!  Wouldn't want it to blow up in
your face, now would we?
~

101 ARMOR~

~

0 ATTEND~

profitable exercise with patience care. 
~

3 AUCTION~
Syntax: auction 
Syntax:	auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax:	auction bid <value>
Syntax:	auction stop

The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing 
auction will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  

If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it will start at 0 
gold.

Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item, and 
auction stop (immortals only) will stop an auction in progress. 

Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported here from a publicly available source.)

At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will soon be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction until level THREE or higher.  To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.
~

101 AUDIT~
The Details About the Immortal Audit:

The Immortal Audit is one that will be held either monthly or bi-monthly.
It is a professional approach, similar to what some companies do when they
analyze themselves for weaknesses. Simply put, you will meet with Gatz and
Spike and discuss your relationship with Cowboy Bebop: Space Cowboy. What
your job is, how well you have executed your job, any extra things you
have done, player ran quests or maybe helping a newbie learn how to do
something. This isn't designed to be a negitive, if we think you have done
a bang up job at being an Immortal, you just might get promoted, however
if you aren't doing your job (builders finishing areas timely and RP
Immortals giving out QP and helping to get players RPing) then you simply
will be removed from the Immortal Staff for being a waste of an Immortal
Slot.
(Be ready at any time to be Audited!)
~

101 AUTH AUTHORIZE AUTHORIZATION~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
continue past the academy pre-auth area, but will make them choose
a new name prior to entering the MUD.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once
this command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands
to enter the game.
 
Authorize <player> no -- denies a player's name and also forces them to
leave the game.

0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KICK PUNCH~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch
 
BACKSTAB is a quick, sneaky way to start a fight.  The shortform of 
backstab is BS.
 
DISARM is a useful tool; use it to relieve your opponent of their weapon,
letting you get the upper hand in a battle.
 
KICK is used much like PUNCH, to inflict pure damage on an opponent.  Max
these skills and you'll have a pretty powerful arsenal at your disposal.

the Universal Banking System (UBS) and now, due to financial problems,
ISSP has taken a priority share in UBS, allowing them a large array of
abilites through the Bank itself. Namely, freezing an account so the
dollars stored no longer can gain direct deposit pay checks or interest.

0 BASH~

temporarily daze both yourself and your opponent for approximately two rounds

(i.e. you will be able to dodge/parry/attack but nothing else).  These same
consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a player character,
otherwise the skill only inflicts damage.
 
Note that bash has a drastically reduced chance of hitting if the basher is
not one of the primary targets (i.e. is not tanking).

0 BEGIN BEGINNER~
Welcome to Cowboy Bebop: Space Cowboy! If you are reading this then chance
is you are new to the MUD. This small helpful guide will start at  from
the stand point of just outside of the Newbie Academy, which is also  west
of the Mars Hospital. You might have noticed that there is some mobs  that
are special in certain ways. In this MUD, there are strict alignment
enforcement, meaning the alignment you are will affect the way the game is
for you, neither good nor evil is better in any way.  Good aligned mobs
are generally obvious, being named things like citizen and so forth. This
is only a general rule, because in different zones there might be some
people who will trick you if you aren't careful, but in the Newbie Areas
it wont be an issue. Evil mobs will be people like gang members and the
sort. Their is neutral mobs aswell, these can be found at Dojos or
training areas that are similar, these mobs are not good nor evil. It
isn't advised that players who don't have much combat skill try and kill
good mobs at first because they WILL give you a bounty placed on your
head, which then allows NPC police, ISSP and RBH to hunt you down and
generally make your start in the MUD a harder time. Walking around Dayton
City, the city outside of the Newbie Academy, you get to see Gang Members
and Citizens a like. Generally most areas are laid out so that gang
Members hang around slumier areas of the town, if their is gang members at
all. Dayton City is full of them, but if you haven't gotten the skill kick
yet, it is a good idea to re-enter the Newbie Academy and kill the boxer
for a few levels (When you level up you get the message 'You feel a bit
more experienced', check practice to see what new skills you can learn and
use at your disposal!) Now, if hunting down mobs isn't your forte then
there is another Newbie Friendly city on Mars called Zephyr City, to
locate it simply take a eastern path of Dayton City and go onto the Mars
Interlink. The Interlink is a simple straight path with no tricks designed
to be a free transit across the planet. In Zephyr City there is shops that
sell Newbie EQ and basic materials to start a career in Engineering, if
you wish to start down that path. Wandering around you will notice a Dojo,
most very new players will find that the white belts are a bit too tough,
but Zephyr is designed to be an ease into the main part of the MUD. Their
is certain quests but it is recommended that a player have atleast
enhanced damage before attempting it in a group, alone the quests should
be done at around the level you gain dual wield. All in all, the best
start up strategy is to go from the Newbie Academy's Boxer, to Dayton City
Gang Member to Zephyr City Dojo Members before you start on your main
journey. Any other questions please use the 'ask' channel, and enjoy your
stay!

101 BESTOWAREA~
Syntax: bestowarea <victim> <filename>.are

use the aassign command to assign themselves that proto area in order
to help the owner of the proto area.
 
Examples:
 
bestowarea joe bob.are           allows joe to work on bob's proto area
bestowarea joe                   lists all of joe's bestowed areas
bestowarea joe list              ditto

few rounds (gouge) to several hundred rounds (the blind power).  If you
are blinded, you will see only your name on the 'who' list, and will be
unable to see either your inventory or your location.

syntax: bootup
syntax: shutoff
 
Bootup turns on a computer in order to use commands associated with computers,
such as who and hackwho.  Shutoff is used to turn the computer off.  It is a
good idea to shut off a computer while not in use, for security reasons.
~

1 BOTTING~
Botting is the nickname of setting a Bot, or Robot to run one's character.
It is done with the use of triggers, which most MUD clients support and
arguably aliases to a certain extent. Setting these up  to run one's
character whilst one is not attentively watching the MUD's screen is
considered Botting. Simply being at the computer is not enough, literally
watching the screen with no other screens above it, ie an Instant
Messenger program or e-mail etc. Botting is illegal in Cowboy  Bebop:
Space Cowboy and punishable in strict means. Generally the punishment will
reflect how the player was botting. Lose of stats, dollars or even skills
is possible. Immortals may check on players occasionally to see if they
are botting, and if they are usually give a roughly ten seconds or so to
respond before punishment. If the player is spamming, or lagging badly
they are advised to not use commands in at a high rate because to a
checking Immortal it looks like botting and the punishment will not be
changed or revoked. Also, if one is triggering a command which has a lot
of spam (ie fills up the screen) or blends in with says or otells then it
is advised to also go slow because that can be mistaken as botting aswell.
Ignorance about any rules is never any acceptable way out of punishment.
Here at Cowboy Bebop: Space Cowboy we allow limited use of triggers and
aliases, however, when they start running you character then it becomes
illegal and punishable. We run a game for players who play the game, not
MUD clients with triggers.

someone's prototype area, and no vnum within the specified range is
a part of a live (non-prototype) area, there will be no result from
this command and the vnums are safe to assign.  If any vnum in the
specified range is already allocated, the area file to which it is
allocated will be displayed.

0 CHEMIST~
In circa 900 AD the art of Alchemy was invented. Throughout the centuries
the art had been practiced and refined into a science. In the last 200
years the science of alchemy has taken a sharp turn and become chemistry.
With the birth of computer in the 1960's chemistry got a jump start into a
more rapidily chaning environment. After the time of the new millenium in
2001 many organisations decided to try to restart 'super-human' programs
counties like Germany had begun. This time, however, the old method of
raising a child from birth and training them up was deemed to primative. A
new wave of chemistry was born, using drugs to alter a person for short
periods of time. The passageway from the brain was the key into making a
powerful drug and although many pills and sirums were made, they all had a
key problem: the pathway to the brain affected their effectiveness.
Approximently 20 years later, circa 2023, a scientist for the Intra Solar
System Police discovered that the eye, without any alteration, could be a
short passage to the brain. He studied sicknesses, like the common cold,
and found that they could enter ones body through the eye. Using this data
he was able to create psuedo-bacteria which could enter the body and into
the brain in a matter of seconds. Many drugs soon sprung up. Now, as of
2071, the drug Bloody Eye is the most powerful drug today. Some people,
however, can not take it because of the purity. Thus, derivates were made.
These derivates are Yellow Eye, Purple Eye, Blue Eye and Green Eye. Modern
chemistry has been forever changed into a race for combat power, used by
both Syndicates and ISSP, in their never ending struggles in their
respective fields.

0 CHEMISTRY~
Having experience in making drugs for so long, one tends to get quicker at
making drugs. The skill chemistry largely reduces the time it takes to
produce any chemist item, including makeapplicator.

Stats of Headquarters
50 Rooms Big
5-10 Clan Guards
5 Pieces of Clan Equipment
 
All clan leaders should expect some involvement with the building of their
HQ but don't expect much. Your level of involvement is dependent on the
Immortal you pick to build it. When a clan is ready for an HQ send an
send an e-mail to Gatz at h_b_k316@hotmail.com with the heading "Space
Cowboy HQ" and say in the e-mail who you wish to build your HQ and

~

0 CLANPK~
These are the rules set forth for Clan Player Attacking:
-When at a Clan HQ (Starting at where it says "Clan Name" Headquarters")
a player can be knocked out. No RP reason needed.

-RBH/Unclanned/GLM players can not go to Clan HQs, you should have no need.
If a player wishes to join in clan fighting they can join one of the current
clans. Otherwise, they can and will be punished.
(Note: RBH can enter clan HQs if they have good reason. Notify an Immortal
before entering a Clan HQ to prevent punishment.)

-For Clans to declare war: the leader most notify the Clan Immortal who then
makes it offical over help motd.
 
-Outside of Clan HQs players still need an RP reason to attack another,
unless a war has been declared.
 
-Logging out inside of Clan HQs that aren't your own is illegal.

-Raids agasnit a clan need to be fair! There is a 1:1 rule in affect, 1
raider per 1 online member of the defending clan. This also imples no raiding
a clan when there are no members online.

-Going AFK at a Clan HQ has new meaning! AFK at a Clan HQ stands
for "A Free Kill"! If you are link-dead you can still be attacked, be careful
and if you start to get laggy evacuate emidiately!

-Clans can not hire other people who are not in their own clan! Clan wars are
between those clans mentioned there, also means non-clan members of that
certain clan in question can not use other people to settle clan issues in PK.
 
-GLM can freely PK people have not paid for services rendered, and may pursue
the offenders anywhere.  (Ie. clan HQs.)

- Hiring people for other services IS legal, but there must be a legitimate
  RP reason for the hiring.  Record a log of this in otells so there is a
  concrete log of the hiring, or if a contreversy arises, the hiring party
  WILL be helled.
 
 
- The ISSP cannot bounty RBH members for attempting to capture bounties.
 
Overall, Immortals have the final word. Anything they deem unlawful can be
punishable. If a Clan is deemed troublesome the members in question shall
get outcast and further punishment to the players may occur.

1 'CONTAINERS' 'CONTAINER'~
Containers are almost a necessity in the game.  They are used to carry
items, food, and drinks.  They help allow you to sort things, by using two
or more types of containers at once.  Corpses use many of the same commands
as regular containers.

EXAM <container> or LOOK IN <container> allows you to see what it contains.

GET <item> <container> allows you to take one item from a container.
GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.
GET ALL.<item> <container> allows you to take all of a particular item type

PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.
PUT ALL <container> will put as much of your inventory in the container as
possible, until the container is full.
PUT ALL.<item> <container> will put as much of one type of item into the
container as possible, until the container is full.

0 CRASH~
You see, the MUD is like a 13 year old girl. She has troubles and issues
and is going through a hard time at school. Trying to balance the heavy
load of work and trying to get dates. When the MUD crashes, she is simply
having an emotional break down. Sometimes caused by boys at school calling
her fat, or her failling a test or getting her period etc. Just bare with
us as we try to calm her down and fix her issues so she can function like
a good girl for all your MUDing pleasures, and if you take that in any
sick way....yes, I will remove your genitalia with a broken ashtray.

When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown
in the verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs
listed from least damage to most damage:
 
   barely scratch               scratch                     graze
   bruise                       hit                         injure

The message shown will reflect the actual damage you are inflicting on
(or receiving from) your opponent, and not a specific fixed amount.
~

101 DAMAGECODE~
This is Kristen's little explanation on the way our mud determines how much
damage you do.
&r------------------------------------------------------------------------
&cFirst, the system checks if you are wielding a weapon or not. If you are,
then you do damage in the range of value1 and value2 of the weapon.
On the other hand, for people not wielding, you do your fist damage which
is coded to be 5-16, any weapons that do less than this are worthless
currently.
&ONext, the system adds the player's damroll to the range.
&pThen, the system multiplies this whole thing by 1+(proficiency% divided
by 100)
&gAfter that, Enhanced damage factors in multiplying damage by (ED%/120)
and adding it all to the damage.
&bFinally, The Kristen property kicks in multiplying all damage by 10.

1 DAUGHTER~
This concerns anyone wishing to have access to the Space Cowboy Code Base.
The Code Base is like my daughter, which I am very protective of. Before
you can see her I need to get to know you. If you try to bullshit me, I
will notice. I will watch you like a hawk when you are near her, and if I
see you touch her: I will kill you. 
~

0 DEATH~
For all of you that fear the great beyond that is death, have no fear:  
The Dayton Hospital staff in Mars is here for any matter of wounds,
battle-scars, or bullets you find lodged in your armor and body.
They have stations all over the galaxy (and even in space itself), 
so you don't have to worry if you get shot down hovering over Ganymede or
battling the farmers with their plasma hoes on Pluto--Dayton's staff
is ready and waiting to help!
 
Just one note of caution:  If you have wounds too severe for current medical
treatment, you may be ambushed by that old corrupt Doctor Baccus and his
staff and put into cryogenic freezing.  But, really, nothing to worry about,
They've been absent from the medical scene for quite some time--an explosion,
or whatnot.
 
So, happy hunting, and don't forget to tip your doctors for the spectacular
work they've devoted themselves to!

0 DESCRIPTION BIO~
Syntax:  description
Syntax:  bio
 
The DESCRIPTION command puts you into an editor to edit your long character
description (what people see when they look at you).
 
The BIO command puts you into an editor to edit your personal bio: what
people see when they check WHOIS on you.
 
For examples of good biographies, check:
http://www.forbiddenone.net/cb/bioexamples.html

A good bio will describe your character's past. It will also touch upon
some of their common emotions or possibly how they developed. A good one will
also have proper spelling, grammar and punctuation. A bad bio will chop out
major details and key events which shape the characters life. For example:
"Tom was a Syndicate member and then they braytrad hem. He tryied to fight
bac but couldnt. So then he got strongr and promised he would go kiling them
for revenge"
Many things are wrong with that, English construction is the obvious one.
To fix this horribly shit-tacular bio, this character needs to fill the gaps.
The bio assumes the reader knows many points of Tom's back story, when infact
the read knows only what the writer has told them or is common knowledge. The
Syndicate mentioned is vague, it could be any of them. Also, it doesn't say how
he trained to improve his skill, maybe he sought out a trainer? Or he used
personal labor to improve. Cliche things aren't always to good to use as a
crutch in trying to fill the gaps either. Stating Tom was trained by an old
master of some sort would be cliche and worn out. Maybe Tom could use instead
that he was trained by going into prison and meeting an old convict who taught
him the true principles of fighting. That would also help to explain more of
how the Syndicate betrayed him. Use some of these methods and more so your
bio will not only be authorized-able but good too!

0 DIG DIGGING BURY BURYING~
Syntax:  dig
Syntax:  dig  <direction>
Syntax:  bury <item>
 
You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of powers such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

-1 DIKU~
Realms of Despair was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
          Michael Seifert                 [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.

1 E~
.              GROUPING WITH OTHER PLAYERS
              -----------------------------
If you are within 5 levels of another character, you have the ability
to group with that player.  You are not able to group a non-deadly
and a deadly character however (see HELP DEADLY). When you are grouped
with another player, you attack mobs together and share the experience
for each kill.
 
Group Commands:
 
  *FOLLOW <player> - you will follow that player at which point they group you
                   - to remove yourself from group type: FOLLOW <your name>

  *GROUP <player> - you add that player to your group
                  - typing GROUP alone will list the people in your group
                  - to remove someone from group type: GROUP <player name>

  *GTELL <message> - you tell the group a message
 
  *SPLIT <amount> - splits the gold among the group

0 EAT DRINK~
Syntax:  drink <object>                  (drink liquid from a drink container)
Syntax:  eat   <object>                  (eat food or a magical pill)
         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or force back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

~

101 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.
 
See ASET, FOLDAREA
~

1 EMPOWER~

first container into the second container.
 
~

0 ENDURANCE~
Syntax: Endurance # (# = time in seconds)
 
The human body is a marvel that no mind could ever truly comprehend or
create a subsitute which matchs it's glory. One of the magnificent
things the human body does is 'feel'. Like many people, the human
body does not like to feel pain, so it has two devices for this. One is
endorphins, to erase the pain, and re-constructive eliments to enable
the body to become stronger. Endurance training pushes the users body
past its natural limits, almost destroying portions of muscle fibers and
ligaments in order to build up condition and make the body less 
susceptable to pain and injury.

1 EQDAMAGE~
While in combat, you may notice that your equipment is taking damage.  For
example, you may see "Your lifebane gets damaged."  Each time this happens,
the AC of the item is damaged by one.  If the AC on an item is 5, after it
is damaged more than five times it will be destroyed or scraped.
 
If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or
another acid attack, your equipment gets "etched and pitted."  When this
occurs the AC on that item is damaged by one permanently.  You cannot
repair the damage done by "pitting and etching."

~

101 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

101 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by power or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

1 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Every discipline has it own way to be leveled in, eg to raise the Combat
Disicipline you need to fight and Fly ships to gain Piloting. Certain
tasks give more or less exp points depending on what level they are and
who they are against, if used on someone. Cowboy Bebop: Space Cowboy tries
to exercise a 'level-less' system where the levels are not told to you in
any way shape or form. This is to provide a more realistic feel to the
mud, instead of saying "I am level 100 fear me!" you don't have that sort
of reasurance, plus it forces players into being more strategic in their
play of their respective characters. As players level up they will have
access to better skills in that respective discipline, with no cross over.
(Leveling up in combat wont give you piloting skills) Each discipline is
unique and Space Cowboy's stance is that a character doesn't need to
master all disciplines to be a good character, everyone is special and
needed. Like wise, some of the primary one likes combat and  bounty
hunting are not necsary to have a good character, but most players like to
fight so they enjoy it. Every discipline improves over the course of
gaining more experience even if the results don't seem appearent at first
glance. Exercise caution becuase sometimes it isn't so easy to tell a
players skill by their characters certain statistics.

0 FAQ~
COWBOY BEBOP FAQs Part 1


Q:  Can I use all caps on the OOC or IC channels?
A:  No.  It's annoying.  You don't see people screaming at 
you in real life, do you?
 
Q:  How strict are the OOC/IC policies?
A:  Fairly strict.  While no one's going to hell you if you 
accidentally type tell instead of otell, please don't go broadcasting 
a person's IC location all over OOC, or talking about the great date 
you went on during a clan summit meeting.
 
Q:  Why am I silenced?
A:  You probably said something to piss the imms off.  Either player 
bashing OOC, caps OOC, or if you were simply being a rude bastard.
 
Q:  Why am I helled?
A:  You could've been doing any of the above to get you silenced, as 
well as botting or multiplaying.
 
Q:  What's the LSC?
A:  The LSC, or Living Stat Code, was a coding venture created by Gatz, 
the Co Owner.  It's basically something that makes you more involved 
with your stats.  All of your stats require hand-training, meaning 
in order to be godly at whacking citizens with your katana, you need 
to spend a lot of time in the gyms perfecting this skill.
 
Q:  How do I apply for a weapons license?
A:  You need to go to either the RBH headquarters in Dayton, 
Mars, or to the GLM recruitment office in the Police Station on 
Ganymede and type applylicense.
 
Q:  Why are people hunting me?
A:  You have a bounty, which means you've done something bad 
(kill civilians, cops, make drugs, hack, piss the ISSP off).
 
Q:  How do I surrender?
A:  Go up to an ISSP or RBH officer and type "surrender [that 
person's name]".  You will lose ten percent of your dollars and
be sent to jail for a periodic amount of time (depending on how 
high your bounty is).

&wCOWBOY BEBOP FAQs Part 2
 
 
Q:  What's the difference between a legal PK and an illegal PK?
A:  This is a tough question.  Help pk covers everything, but 
people get so confused in those rules that sometimes they just 
need it respelled out for them.  So let me kindly do that for you.
 
&rA legal PK is something that has an in game reason.&w  
A la... If you have a bounty, you're a target for RBH and ISSP.  If you're 
in a clan that's warring with another clan, the other clan can kill you 
or your friends in your clan.  IC revenge is legal, HOWEVER:  If you 
have an alt, you can not revenge your alt.  
 
&rAn illegal PK is a PK that has no in game reason.&w  For instance, if 
a player said something you didn't agree with on OOC, you can't kill 
them for it in game.
 
&rThe grey area:&w
This is fought over a lot.  The current grey area issue is that of 
preemptive strike:  If you think someone is hunting you, can you go 
after them without proof (that being a grenade thrown at you, 
someone focusing you, attacking you, etc.  words do not count as proof)?  
The answer to this is, no, you cannot.  You need proof to go after someone
chasing you.
Hope that helped.
 
Q:  What is Big Shot?
A:  Big Shot is where all of the bounties (people who have 
done something bad to get a reward placed on their head for 
their death/surrender) are shown.  If you see your name on it, 
you have a bounty for one reason or the next.
 
Q:  Where do I buy a ship?
A:  Ships can only be bought at ship auctions, which are held 
periodically.
 
Q:  How much do ships cost?
A:  Ships go anywhere from 50 million dollars to 700 million dollars, 
depending on the model and make.
 
Q:  Why do you spell it dollar and not woolong?
A:  Just a little quirk misspelling that Gatz and Spike liked 
so much they kept it in.
 
Q:  What makearmor locations are there?
A:  See "help talon" or "help wearflags" on the game.
 
Q:  Are there any Imms on?
A:  Check who.  If no one's on under Legendary Cowboys, chances are 
the imms are either A) not on or B) in hiding.  Most imms will come 
out if you ask a question, though, if they're hiding.

0 FAQ3~
COWBOY BEBOP FAQs Part 3
 
 
Q:  What's the difference between a CC ship and a named ship?
A:  CCs can be flown by anyone, whereas named ships are privately 
owned and can only be flown by the pilot, copilot, or owner, or 
someone who has the skill hijack.
 
Q:  How do you fly a ship?
A:  To fly a public ship, you simply type "open cc" and then "board cc" 
or "enter cc".  To fly a private ship, the same rules apply unless you 
are not a pilot on the ship, then it requires you to "pick [ship]", "enter 
[ship]", and "hijack [ship]."  Pickshiplock and hijack are high smuggling 
skills, though, and they can't be used by just anyone.
 
Q:  How do you get to Zephyr City from Dayton via walking?
A:  From the Dayton City Interlink, found by walking west from 
the airport or east from Town Square.
 
Q:  Who sells the best weapons?
A:  That's something you generally have to decide for yourself, 
depending on what weapon-types you like.   Clan weapons give extra 
dr/hr and stats, but weapons made by the Galactic League of Merchants 
do great damage as well.  Also, heavy weapons do a lot of damage, but 
have very few rounds per ammo clip.
 
Q:  How do I join a clan?
A:  You go up to the Leader, First, or Second of the clan you want to 
join (found by typing "clans"), and ask to join.  Some clans have stat 
limits, however, meaning that you have to have X level in combat or all 
of your base stats at X before you can join.
 
Q:  How do I gain skills?
A:  Skills are generally gained by first learning the skill if it's 
at 0% in your "practice" list by going to a trainer (The master in the 
Venus Dojo and the pilot in Dayton spaceport are two that come to mind) 
and typing "prac [skill]".  However, that only gets the skill up so 
far.  You have to actively practice the skill to make it go up.  Players 
with high Wis and Int levels can also teach you skills at a higher level 
than the NPC trainers, but you have to find them first.
 
Q:  What counts as "botting"?
A:  Botting on this mud is defined by A) using triggers when you're not 
at the computer to gain skills, or B) backlogging a skill infinitely so 
that you could go away and come back thirty minutes later and have your 
character still practicing said skill.  Basically, anything that doesn't 
require you to be at the computer while playing the mud counts as botting.
For more info, see help botting.

0 FAQ4~
COWBOY BEBOP FAQs Part 4
 
 
Q:  Is multiplaying allowed?
A:  No.
 
Q:  Can I have an alt?
A:  Yes, but your alt cannot have any relationship with your other 
character, as ICly, you'd never technically get to know the other.  
Alt characters also are usually restricted to joining the same clan 
their main character is in, unless the main character is not in a clan, 
or belongs to RBH or GLM.
 
Q:  Where can I get a laptop?
A:  From the computer repairman in Dayton City, Mars.
 
Q:  Why can't I attack this mob?
A:  You're either in a safe room, which prohibits fighting, or the 
mob is a pacifist, and you can't fight it.
 
Q:  How can I see my level?
A:  Basically, you can't, as this is a mock 'levelless' system.  You can, 
however, see what skills you're close to, and figure out how far you 
are in that class that way.

automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows a leader to disband his group (members stop following
 and are ungrouped).

~

101 FOR~
Syntax:  for <argument> <command>
Syntax:  for <argument> <command> <target>
 
For allows an immortal to perform a command at or even on a large
number of targets.  The arguments include:  all, mobs, gods.
 
Example:  for gods gl, you will 'glance' in the room of every god
who is online (include link-dead)
 
You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on
every mob in the game.
 
'For' does not override private flags.
~

101 FORCECLOSE~
Syntax: forceclose <descriptor>

This command will force a certain descriptor to close.
This is useful to disconnect connections that aren't really connected
due to a poor TCP connection.

It can also be used to forceclose a connection before a potential
problem player can even get to the authorization state of connection.

See USERS, CONSTATES and DISCONNECT.
~

101 FORMPASS~
Syntax:  formpass <new password> <character name>
Example: formpass temporary Joseph
                                       
Used to help in changing a character's password if they have forgotten or
misplaced their own.
 
This command will return the encrypted form of the specified password for
the specified character name.  Password and character name are case
sensitive, and the character name _must_ be capitalized.  The resulting
encrypted password must then be pasted into the character's pfile offline
by someone with access to player files.
 
~

101 FQUIT~
Syntax:  fquit <character>
 
Can be used by low-level imms to force a level 1 player to quit the game,
for example if the player is accidentally authorized or is causing problems
and there are no higher immortals around to deal with the problem.  Fquit
does not work on any player higher than level 1.
 
~

0 FRENZY~
Syntax: Frenzy

   The human body is a dynamic entity all to itself. When the brain
perceives an urgent situation, it produces a special chemical called
adrenaline. This chemical can aid in a human's "Flight or Fight" response.
While usually at normal levels, this response is greatly heightened by 
the increase of adrenaline flowing throughout the body.  For some, when
adrenaline levels peak, they can achieve great feats of strength and
power; unfortunately, few can control this surge.  Users who have the
skill "Frenzy" have a good chance of gaining control of this heightened
state to use it for their advantage in combat.

  message, not the general board. Also, you may report things to immortals
  by posting a message to "imms". This will send it to all immortal staff.
~

0 GHEAL GROUP_HEAL~
Syntax: Group Heal

In times of intense battles, Medics can not allow themselves to be bogged
down with working on one patient at a time, instead they need to hussle
around quickly and treat may people as fast as they can. Group Heal
doesn't heal as much as some of the other skills do, however, paired with
Field Research and Master Medic can be an awesome skill.

~

0 GLM~
GLM, or the Galactic League of Merchants, is a group created by the ISSP to
assure the sufficient education and growth of suitable engineers
throughout the galaxy that may collaborate for the betterment of the solar
system.  Similar to RBH, they aren't an official part of the ISSP, and yet
they still were created, and in theory could be disbanded by them if they
saw the need to do so.   They were created in response to the great
catastrophy which destroyed the ISSP recreational casino ship, Jubilee. 
Reports of engineering problems causing the ship's destruction lead to
ISSP forming the group of engineers so an incident like that would never
happen again.                                                             
                                                                          
Members of the GLM recieve discounted prices in purchasing their
engineering expenses, as well as learning to understand construction
processes more quickly from their own concentration on the subject and
from the insight that their combrads may provide them.  In turn, they're
discouraged from taking time from their concentrated engineering studies
to pursue feuds, and tend to pay less attention to these fights because of
it, learning less.  Lastly, upon abandoning your skilled bretheren, you
lose the insight their unspoken knowledge provided you, losing some of the
skill you formerly possessed.

A global RP can be a variety of things involving the whole mud.  
Global RPs involve mass QP-giving, so if you like RPing and 
desperately want to up that luck stat, join in!
 
Some general rules regarding GRPs:
 
A)  You *MUST* have your RP flag up to get QP.  I cannot
stress this enough.  Help setrp, if you don't know how to
put your flag up.
 
B)  No PKing during area-based RPs, please.  Having people 
suddenly get up in the middle of a concert and start shooting
= not cool.  So, please, think rationally when you're RPing
in a public place with a bunch of other people.
 
C)  If you're abusing the setrp flag (pretending to participate
but not actually doing anything) the Imms will call you on it,
and bad things will happen.  So only have the RP flag up if you
plan to actually RP.
 
 
Scavenger-Based RP Rules:
A) If you see a clue on the ground and -are- not playing, do not 
pick it up.
 
B) Do not keep clues once you've found them.  =Drop= them after 
you've read them, please.
 
C)  There -are- false clues around, so don't think you can just go 
around searching for random clues and get ahead.  Also, there are 
instances where the Imms may not drop the latest clue until the
last one out has been found by at least one person. No cheating,
basically.
 
 
Most of all, have fun, relax, and RP, RP, RP! :)

Session:  Potter's Revenge
 
The nefarious Harry P, unsatisfied with prison life after almost taking over
the solar system, has decided that to win his next battle with the
inhabitants, he needs drugs.  Large quantities of drugs.  This evening, 
Harry was spotted running out of an ISSP warehouse with a bag full of 
previously confiscated Bloody Eye.  Lucky for the ISSP, Harry's a pretty
messy guy, and has been leaving scraps of paper as clues all over 
the solar system.  Your mission, space cowboys?  Use his littering to
track down that villan, kill him, and bring his goods back to the doorstep of 
ISSP HQ where we will meet you!
 
The team that brings in the bag of bloody eye will get 5 million dollars
to split and 3 QP each; however, teams can also earn QP during the 
RP itself, so everyone wins! :)

0 GRP2~
Session:  The Eldest Mistake
 
In the late 2040s, Soukai Corp decided they were going to get an edge on their
competition by sending spaceflights and test crews to Pluto.  Soukai named
the Pluto branch Stoker Industries, and in order to cover up their experiments
on the soil, water, and life of Pluto, told the press Stoker Industries was
being sent there to open a mall:  the SI Mall.  Stoker Industries first 
established an underground base some 30 miles away from the mall site before
opening a hypergate for construction crews to come in. 
 
In 2050, the mall opened to great fanfare and success, with Stoker still 
continuing their research on the planet.  However, an enviromental group
got word of Stoker (and Soukai's) intentions.  In 2051, the group dropped a
hydrogen bomb on Stoker Industries' site.  The shockwave rippled through the
mall, somehow freezing the time there.  Every clerk, shopper, and person in
the SI Mall to this day believe the date is April 1st, 2051.  Believing their
work to be finished, the terrorists scattered, leaving Pluto a hydrogen 
wasteland.
 
However, several members of the Stoker Industries team had survived the blast,
though vastly deformed.  No one could tell which person was which, who was who,
and the colonists, if they had the notion of fear left in their brains, should
have been frightened out of their wits by now.
 
(Continued in help grp2a)
~

0 GRP2A~
Later that year, the miracle occured.  5 colonist and scientist women gave
birth to 5, beautiful healthy children.  3 boys, two girls, the eldest of which
was the boy the colonists and his brothers and sisters had taken to calling
"The Elder".  As a whole, the 5 children looked at themselves as salvation,
and decided quickly to banish all forms of impurity.  They made the misshapen
and deformed colonists slaves, who, through a series of inbreeding, became
the plasma hoe farmers most people know about today.  Soon after that united
decision, the Eldest decided he wanted more power, so he declared he had 
right over everyone on Pluto.  The Eldest now ruled over the slaves, and 
Ranks 1 - 4.  Soon after, the Eldest decided to marry Rank 1 to Rank 2 and
Rank 3 with Rank 4 to create the new Ranks 1a and 2a.  The 1a parents only
had one child, a girl, 1a1, also known as Eirlyn Wailes.  Rank 2a had 5
children, 2a1, 2a2, 2a3, 2a4, 2a5.  
 
So, by this time, the Eldest had decided he wanted a bride.  The logical, 
purest choice for him was Eirlyn.  She was the highest born besides his 
siblings, and so at an early age, he sent the 1a family to Earth to 
educate Eirlyn in the ways of the solar system.  However, his plan
backfired.  Eirlyn, when she was nineteen, found out about her 
heritage and the Eldest's plan, and ran far, far away from her 
hometown on Earth.  She met with Giraldus, Taille, and Bran, 
explaining as much as she could about the barbarous practices of
the Eldest and Pluto civilization in general.
 
Appalled by these goings on without ISSP knowledge, Giraldus founded
a sub-division of ISSP called the Elder Project, and made Taille the
head of the program.  She has been searching vainly for clues on
how to break down this society, but it's not been easy.  After all, 
there are rumors that the Eldest has supernatual powers of some
sort... And no sane person wants to go up against a radiation-born
child.
 
 
The latest news on the case:
Apparently, the Eldest has given the word for several of his agents
to appear at Giraldus and Krystalia's wedding, for he has heard 
that both Eirlyn and Taille will be at such a momentous event. 
Taille hopes to trap the agents when they appear, and hold them
for questioning.  The Elder Project can only hope they'll give
us some leads...

Session:  Night of the Flying Doggie

The solar system's dealt with the nefarious Harry P, that pesky 
Eldest... But can it deal with the newest threat yet--fluffy purple 
CORGIS?!    Yes, indeed, these little things are flooding the 
planet, and no one quite knows where they're coming from... 
The only clue so far is a graffiti'd tag reading "CAS"... 
 
It's up to YOU, the inhabitants of Mars, G37, Venus, Ganymede, 
Io, and Pluto, to save us all from this threat.  Who knows what the 
mighty CAS could stand for... Or what they're doing in our galaxy?

despite the announcement of the Giant Thanksgiving feast inviting people all

Christian Tholesen felt pretty angry that his bounty was worth
nothing without the mastermind.  Now out of prison, Christian
has decided to make a name for himself.  Venus is now in danger
with a wannabe badass out to make a name for himself.  Christian
has built a bomb that will destroy all of Venus, and has placed
12 detonators around the planet.  To compound the problem, Christian
has hired thugs to ensure that he controls all the detonators.
Played Out:
12 detonators will be placed around Venus.  1 qp will be rewarded
per detonator found.  Low level aggressive thugs will be placed
all around Venus to give some of the lowbies a chance of getting
a few kills in.  Once all the detonators will be found, Christian
Tholesen (whom I will switch bodies with) will run around Venus
taunting the players to defeat him.  The player who defeats him
will be awarded special eq.

100 HELPFILE FILE HELPFILES~
To edit/make a help file there are some basic and yet confusing
commands
necessary.  So here we go...
hedit <helpfile>
hset level 1 <helpfile>
hset keyword "<word list>" <helpfile>
hset save <helpfile>
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
If you successfully HIDE, other characters and creatures cannot see you
unless they are affected by 'detect hidden'.
 
If you successfully SNEAK, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other characters.
 
In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.
 
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.
~

1 HIJACK~
.
Syntax : Hijack
 
This skill allows you to "borrow" other peoples ships
~

1 HIRE~
Space Cowboy accepts applications for immortalization quite frequently. If
you wish to apply simply drop a line to Spike but be forewarned it isn't a
free ride. Here is a listing of tasks you can expect to be assigned to for
every role. 
 
Roleplay Immortals:
Auth Names
Player related global RP's
Test New Areas (if needed)
 
Player Tester Immortals:
Auth Names
Answer Mud Questions
Test New Areas
 
Builder Immortals:
Auth Names
Answer Mud Questions
Complete Areas at a Timely Fashion
 
As always Immortals reflect the quality of a mud so Space Cowboy seeks only
the hardest working people to become Immortals. Laziness and lack of
motivation won't be accepted excuses. Furthermore if you wish to use
Immortal powers to enhance any alt characters: that is out of the question.
To summarize what is the main point of being an Immortal is to be a public
servant. If you simply can't stand authority or feel you should not be
told what to do, you have no business becoming an Immortal. For the others
who still wish to become an Immortal with hard work you can get promotions
fairly quickly. Good Immortals are hard to come by and your work is
always appreciated.
 
&RNote:&w If you are applying for a builder spot please include a small, 
3-5 rooms area you made in notepad! It needs to have a mob or two with a 
program. We use this to see your skill!
If you are applying for Roleplay Immortal send a sample of your RP work.
Maybe a page or two or you RPing with someone ON THIS MUD! Your portion of
the RPing will be judged. Spelling, grammar, and originallity will all be
considered!
If you are applying for Player Tester Immortal then send a short description
of your past experiences, if any. Also, send logs of times you helped out
mortals, or even helped resolve conflict. Player Tester Immortals are special
because they need to be able to handle, not only pressure to test areas
to remove ALL bugs and spelling errors but handle player related conflicts.
 
&RAmmendment:&w You need to send an e-mail to BOTH Spike and Gatz when
applying for an Immortal spot! Using tells and/or gnotes is not acceptable!
Failure to apply properly will make your application completely void!
Spike and Gatz' e-mails are found on the start up screen. EG, right
above where you type your name to log in.
 
&RIf you just logged onto the mud to apply for an Imm postion than
don't bother! We only hire from players who we can observe and have past
exeperience with! &w
~

1 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
 
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>
 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
~

101 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

10 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>
 
example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html
 
If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they
select the 'see who's on' link from the Realms of Despair
home page.
 
To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.
~

101 HSET~
Syntax:  hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in powercasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

1 IC OOC "IN CHARACTER" " OUT OF CHARACTER"~
&C

IC - In character - Means that you're not chatting with your friends about
friday nights plans, or what to wear to the mall, it means what your MUD
CHARACTER is saying. Ignorance is  no excuse for misusing channels, if you
mean to jokingly tell someone OOC you're going to kill them but do it IC
they have every right to defend themselves and attack you if they feel
threatened. You can use the ask and answer, as well as tell channels (if
you don't understand  them there's a reason someone teaches languages)
if;you want to talk OOC or just go to a hotel, it's not that difficult and
it's cheaper then using IC and clears up any confusion and lessens whining
because someone was killed because they "accidentally said the wrong
thing on the wrong channel".
&Y
OOC - Out of Character - Means you're talking about issues not
game related like a bug or have another mud-based question, this
does not mean you go "Hey Jim I need food pick me up" or "Hey 
So and So just killed me I'm gonna get you!" however there are a 
constantly growing number of help files and most of your basic 
questions should be there for answering, but yes there are times
here there are questions only an imm or a fellow player can answer.
However Excessive abuse of OOC will result in possibly being silenced.

1 IMBECILE~
Yes, we agree with you, maybe you should get some help?
~

101 IMMCHANGES~
Date     IMM       Change
----------------------------------------------------------------
12-13-03 Kristen    Fixed it so you can multiplay without getting booted.
.                   Imms still receive the message however.
12-13-03 Kristen    New Command: ipcompare
12-13-03 Kristen    Added many new ifchecks, type help ifchecks, ifchecks2,
.                   and ifchecks3 to see them all.
12-14-03 Kristen    The effect proficiency affects damage has been lowered,
.                   reducing damage by 1/6-1/2.
12-18-03 Kristen    Damage was raised a bit for lowbies.
12-20-03 Kristen    ISSP doesn't get revenue from conquered planets
.                   anymore.
12-20-03 Kristen    Purge and Sacrifice now give messages when used.
12-23-03 Kristen    Reinputted the 49 line buffer limit that SOMEONE
.                   removed. It was causing horrible crashes without
.                   having it.
12-23-03 Kristen    And then I took the buffer a step further. (changes6)
01-01-03 Kristen    Messed with clan stuff a bit.
01-01-03 Kristen    Fixed switch not to trap you in link dead players.
01-03-04 Kristen    Grenades weren't getting the times 5 modifier so they
.                   were too weak. Now they do value0 through value1 damage
.                   times 5. (a good grenade is 100-200 damage)
01-07-04 Kristen    Added a command called mortality. See help mortality.
~

101 IMMHQ~
.
This is for Immortal's building clan HQ's
 
50 Rooms MAX
5-10 Guards (Not all of them in one room or maxed on power)
 
5 Pieces of Unique EQ (Clan Related EQ, nothing inappropriate)
For EQ something like a Weapon and 4 Pieces of other EQ is a nice set to
create.The EQ can't be overpoweringly strong. If the weapon is a gun make
sure there is AMMO for it! If the weapon is a sword make sure to make it
weaker than a gun because it needs no ammo!
 
 
Try to make the HQ fair and not over powered. In the future HQ's might be
able to raid them but for now there isn't any raiding policy, just be
aware the HQ needs to have something in this area (A maze, a key etc.).
Remember the HQ must have a way for people who aren't clanned to gain
access to it! This is for the future raiding ability of clans, future is
the keyword though.
 
When you build a clan HQ you can let the leader of the clan help you as
much as you wish them too. This is left open because some builders prefer
lots of help, some none.
~

101 IMMORTALIZE~
Syntax:  immortalize <character>
 
Used to advance a level 100 character (avatar) to level 101 (the first
level of immortality).  This command will destroy the character's

~

101 IMMRULES~
These are the rules for Immortals, these rules can NOT be broken, if you
have any problems with these send a gnote on GB 5 to Spike and Gatz, but
realize you -still- need to follow them regaurdless of how you like them.
 
Rules:
 
1) You are allowed to have Alts, but the majority of your time should be on
your Immortal character (About 3:1 ratio).
 
2) Your Alt is not an Immortal, he needs to follow all rules a Mortal does,
including not being a bastard.
 
3) You need to Authorize names, if one is not suitable use the 'name' function
located within the authorize command.
 
4) Log in atleast 7 hours a week, very bare minimum!
 
5) Don't ask for promotions.
 
6) Never reveal character data to any Mortal.

7) You CAN NOT go Invisible to avoid players EVER.

8) You can only go Invisible (Under the Level of Head Roleplay) if you are
actively working on an area (Builder Immortals Only) or watching an RP
(Role Play Immortals Only) actively. Active is the keyword, typing a
description in once every 5 minutes isn't active.
 
9) Only level 110 and up Immortals can go invisible for leisure.
 
10) Basic Rule for Invis, if it isn't for being productive, don't use it.

Builder Specific Rules:
 
1) Build in a timely manor. Areas which take you longer than a month should be
about 300 vnums large or larger.
 
2) If you repeated build slowly, you will be denied large sets of vnums!
 
3) You are expected to be able to do 50 vnums (100% finished) a week.
 
4) If you can't build that fast, then you most take it up with Spike or Gatz
and then show that you improve your speed over time.
 
5) If you go longer than a month without building an area or working on one,
you will be fired, no questions ask.
 
6) Don't ask to build ships, that is reserved for higher level builders.
 
7) If a Building Deadline is given, try to meet it not matter what.
 
Roleplaying Specific Rules:
 
1) Reward QP fairly, but do not exceed 1 QP per 30 minutes of RP.
 
2) Offer RP help to players struggling.
 
3) Try to do RP events, like classes, to inspire RP regularly.
 
4) Be on often to offer player help and fix helpfiles (help hedit)
 
5) Never refuse a player help if it is reasonable.
 
Final Over Rules:
 
- Keep an upbeat additude and be proud that you work here!
- Remember to always be pleast with Mortals, even when they are not!
- Work hard, and you will be promoted!

that are in the room with them.  This power will also allow you to get
items from a corpse, but will not allow you to see the corpse.  You
must have a light source to see items, room descriptions, or "exits" in
a dark room.
~

101 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax:  installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>
 
Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.  The
filename can be fixed with aset (don't forget to foldarea afterwards).
 
Installarea renames the installed area file from 'author.are.file' to
'author.are.installed' so that the builder may be assigned new vnums.
 
~

101 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
Syntax:  instaroom
 
Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.
 
Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]
 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.

0 ISSP-LAWS~
ISSP has always had a presence in the universe, sometimes less then
other times, and sometimes more. And in this case, it's true that
more is better. After much deliberation and revising the following
 
Drugs: Drug use is illegal, period. Rawdrugs are the exception to this 
law, any variation of the 'eye' drug will constitute a violation of this
law. Any persons found, or suspected with this drug will find
themselves bountied and hunted until caught. A violation of this law
constitutes a minimum of 400k dollar bounty, with no maximum bounty.
Note: Applicators also fall into this area, with a lesser bounty of
200k dollars, a maximum of 500k dollars.
 
Hacking: The illegal use of computers has always been a problem, even
during old earth. Those caught using Computers, laptops, palm PC's,
datapads, or any other such variation of electronics to damage,
 change, transfer, or attack other electronic systems will be bountied
and hunted until caught. A violation of this law constitutes a minimum
of 500k dollar bounty, with no maximum bounty.

Threats:  Anyone found threatening any other player verbally or physically 
can be bountied from 5,000 dollars to 500,000 dollars.
 
Theft: Theft is always, and will always be a problem. And is always
 hard to prove. A violation of this law constitutes a bounty of 300k
minimum dollar bounty, with a maximum of 500k dollar bounty.
Note: Stealing from mobs is also theft.
 
Murder: Murder is a serious offense, and will be punished to the
 maximum extent of the law. A 1 million bounty minimum is imposed
 for murder, with no maximum bounty.

101 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.
 
Valid numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

0 LIFT~
Syntax: Lift # (If no number, then the default is 1)

In order to gain strength, one needs to use free weights to gain a
higher strength. Using the command 'lift' in a gym, one lifts his highest
weight potential, and forces his body to gain strength through labor. If
one doesn't do lifting over a large period of time, then they will lose what
they worked so hard to gain. One doesn't need to be in a gym to lift, but one
gains more by being in one.
(Note: The only area outfitted for gym training is Venus' Sakura Dojo)

~

0 LIMIT~
The human body is capible of many things, the ability to grow in response
to most situations and handle, sometimes unbeilievibly, high stress.
However, the human body has it's limits. Understand those limits can allow
people to rise to even higher limits working around what may be a
weakness. So, stats will not gain forever and ever, also, there is a limit
to how many stats a person can have. No one can be a super human monster,
however, people can configure themselves to fit their gameplay choice.
Basicly, every player is able to get 15 in all their stats (Wisdom is
ignored and allowed to hit 18) but in order to get to the 18 stat level,
it requires such intense focus, it limits how stats can be spent in other
fields. Thus, creating (and forcing) players to decide which stats they
truly want.

101 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax:  log   <character>
Syntax:  log   all
Syntax:  snoop <character>
 
LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.
 
Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)

0 MEDIC~
The Medical profession has spanned for centuries. Medicine practices have
been traced to Ancient Egypt and Ancient Eastern Cultures. Most modern
medicine has come from the Greeks and Romans, which first brought the idea
that water can cleanse. Roman Doctors use to treat solider wounds with
bandages and use an anti-septic (Honey, which will not grow bacteria). The
practice of Medicine slowly advance, in the early have of the 20th Century
intense procedures became possible, like open heart surgeory. In the late
20th Century, aided by computers, the Human Body's code itself was cracked
and Scientists were first able to look at the basic components of a Human
being, and then the Medicine rush came afterwards. Today, it is possible
to get replacement body parts which look and feel like real, and have zero
rejection. Of course with traveling around the Galaxy there are conditions
which account from that, keeping practical Medicine busy as it ever was.

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

100 NOKILL KILL NO~
A 'nokill' flag has been added for NAMED mobs. It doesn't make sense
for some mobs to die and then suddenly be back alive again ( the ones
with names as opposed to ones like anonymous stormtroopers etc ).
This flag will cause the mob that has it to appear to flee before it
dies... It will still give experience but won't leave a corpse lying
around.

and after that number.

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.

NOTE WRITE puts you into edit mode, where you can easily enter your note
with use of some simple editor commands:
            /? - help    /s - save    /l - list    /c - clear

NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE TAKE takes the note as in NOTE REMOVE, as well as physically taking 
it in your inventory.

      :	olist <first object>
      :	olist <first object> <last object>

This command will list all of the prototype objects in your area, when used 
with no arguments.  When used with a single argument it will list all 
objects including and after the argument, and when used with two arguments, 
it will list all objects including and between the two. 
~

101 OMENU~
The menu commands are no longer in operation.

~

101 OPEDIT~
Syntax:  opedit <object> <command> [number]  [program] [arguments]
Syntax:  opedit <object> add       <program> <arguments>

101 OPSTAT~
Syntax: opstat <object/object vnum>
 
Opstat will display all of the objprograms that have been written for the
specified object.  If a copy of the object exists in the game, it can be
accessed by its vnum.
 
See OPEDIT, TRIGGER, OPTRIGGERS, OPCOMMANDS, IFCHECKS, IFCHECKS2 VARIABLES
~

0 OSAY~
When wanting to speak to someone about non-IC (in character) events, use
osay. Osay marks the message as being OOC and mobs will not be able to see
them. Also, osay is purely OOC, so it can't affect PK logic.
~

101 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

0 PLAYERWIPE PWIPE~
A pwipe, short for player wipe, is when all the pfiles on the mud get
erased, or wiped. All the ships get their owners removed aswell. This may
seem like a negitive, but is actually very positive. Pwipes are needed
when large amounts of a certain code are added in, or when a unfortunate
bug happens and everything gets messed up beyond belief. Pwipes are always
kept at a very minimum, but will take place if need be. Once the mud
offically opens there will be no more pwipes, but until then please bare
with us. We hope you continue playing even after a pwipe, often they can
be the most fun times, but if you don't we thank you for the time you
spent with us.

0 QUESTPOINTS QP QUESTREWARD GLORY~
Quest points will be awarded for participating in RP situations, and
random quests.  Quest points maybe used for the following:

2 qp-Change the name of an item
4 qp-Add a program in your apartment(Nothing that can heal!)
5 qp-Have an immortal tell you a stat, such as hitroll, damroll, AC.
5 qp- Have an Immortal tell you what your current levels are.
5 qp-Get title ability back (If you lost it)
30 qp-Change sex
100 qp-+1 luck
 
&RNote:&w One can also gain QP by reporting rule breakers. Some
examples of rule breaking include the following:
- Logging out in ships that don't belong to you or your clan.
- Illegally PKing.
- Harassment.

Trying to lie to get QPs will get yourself helled or deleted!
 
&rNote 2:&z&w  A roleplaying situation can consist of either nature (serious
or humorous).  HOWEVER.  Do not expect to get QP if you just sit around
and talk in OOC or make one or two almost-OOC comments (EX:  During a 
Clan summit - XXX says "When's the celebratory drinks coming?").
 
&rNote 3:&z&w  Earning QP is a PRIVILEGE, not a right.  Imms will always
make the final call.  Demanding to be given X QP because you think you 
deserve it won't get you anywhere at all with your RP imms, so be smart 
and don't be whiny.  
 
&rNote 4&z&w:  Quests are done -at random- unless they're
scheduled GRPs, so no asking for so-and-so to do a quest!

101 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax:  rassign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>
 
These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for
so that they may build inside that range.  Use the 'checkvnums' command
before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.
 
Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.
 
See CHECKVNUMS, ZONES, NEWZONES, VNUMS

0 RBH BOUNTYHUNTER BOUNTY HUNTER~
The RBH (Registered Bounty Hunters) are the group of individuals licenced
to track down those people with bounties on their head and turn them into
the government, still living, or at least slightly so, for large sums of
money.  They were created by the police and the solar system's government
to serve as a buffer, to stop the crime harbingers that the police don't
have enough power to, or even enough political power to control.  The
point in this organization is simply to help the police cut down on the
rampunt crime running about the galaxy, and for those unaffiliated with
the government to make a little money in the process.

101 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 101 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,

another cannot do one until 6 hours has passed, regardless of whether or
not they have not done one that day.
 
A Greater God or higher can do a restore all whenever they wish, and are
not constrained by the above limitations.
 
Use 'restoretime' to see when the last restore all was done.

0 RP ROLEPLAYING~
RP, or Roleplay, is the play of the MUD acting as your own character would,
staying in character (IC) for all roleplay actions you carry out.  All
global channels are currently OOC channels, and tell, yell, say, shout,
and space channels can optionally be RPed in or not when you use them,
this isn't strongly enforced, but it is possible to ruin an RPer's fun
completely by simply walking into things and starting to chat OOC to
them... Some people find it fun to roleplay, and others don't, so the only
action that is mandatory for your character to RP is a cause for attacking
someone, if your character has no reason to kill someone, you have no
choice but to leave them alone.                                           
                                                                          
Roleplay is not enforced, but is condoned.  Several incentives exsist for
those who do RP.  RP classes are held regularly, and are announced in the
Announcement gnote board.
 
See help setrp.

1 RULES~
&zThe rules of Cowboy Bebop:  Space Cowboy.
&R1) &zStay in character at all time when not on an 
    out of character channel.  If you follow rules 
    like you would do in real life, in most cases 
    you will be ok on the mud.

&R2)  &zYou are responsible for your own character.  
    Whatever happens to your character is your
    fault, including lost password, or any other
    rules violation.

&R3)  &zNO BOTTING whatsoever.  You wouldn't be able
    to not pay attention while slaughtering someone
    in real life, let's try to keep this as close to
    reality as possible.
    (Help botting for more details)

&R4)  &zNo multiplaying.  Unless you are on a legit
    lan, you will delete and/or banned for multiplaying.

&R5)  &zDon't advertise other muds or post sick
    links in public areas. If you're unsure about what's
    acceptable ask an Immortal.

&R6)  &zBe nice... and don't harass.  Being a dick 
    to the players and/or immortals will get your ass
    kicked.

&R7)&z  No logging out in ships that don't belong to you
    or your clan!

&R8)&z  Say is IC only! Abuse of osay and say is illegal.

&R9)&z  Insults are legal IC, but in any OOC form are illegal.
    If any insults are deemed to be 'too far' or threats the
    player will be either helled, deleted or banned. If you
    don't know if are not sure if an insult is too far, don't
    use it at all.
 
 
&WPlease also refer to help &RPK&W and help &RCLANPK&W for additional rules.
~

0 RUMORS~
Syntax: Spread (Target) (Victim)

Spreading of false truth is what the purest meaning of a rumor is. Most
rumors are not true, however, sometimes they are. Regardless, spreading
rumors about a player to a mobile will cause that mobile to immidately
begin hunting to kill them. This, however, will not make the mobile
frustrated at the victim.
~

1 SACRIFICE~
Syntax:  sacrifice <object>
 
Sacrifice offers an object to the gods.
The gods may reward you for the sacrifice, and the nature of the reward
depends upon the type of object.
 
Hint: the gods like corpses.
~

1 SAVE~
Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves one character approximately
minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.
~

101 SAVEAREA LOADAREA~
Syntax: savearea
        loadarea

Savearea and loadarea will save or load your prototype area.
 
A God or higher may load or save any other prototype area by simply

0 'SECOND ATTACK' 'THIRD ATTACK' 'FORTH ATTACK' 'FIFTH ATTACK'~
These skills let you attack more than once during a combat round.  Use of
these skills is automatic once you have practice them.

to dole out medication, but its affects are not very good and it is always
better to have another Doctor aid inseatd of oneself.

101 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

+ don't consume this component
@ decrease component's value[0], and extract if it reaches 0
# decrease component's value[1], and extract if it reaches 0
$ decrease component's value[2], and extract if it reaches 0
% decrease component's value[3], and extract if it reaches 0
^^ decrease component's value[4], and extract if it reaches 0
&& decrease component's value[5], and extract if it reaches 0
and ! will make the power fail if the caster is carrying that component.

0 STATTRAIN~
The revolutionary system of Cowboy Bebop: Space Cowboy is based on real
life stats gain! If you work a certain part of your stats (eq Str, Dex,
Cha, etc) you gain points! The more you work the more those stats last.
Infact you can even do a small 10 minute or less daily routine to keep
up those new stats you gained. In some cases skills will even give you
points in that field! For example using combat moves counts as exercise
to raise Str, and such is for all stats. The average is about 5 hours to
lose all your gain, if you refuse to use anything to gain. This system
is simple to avoid penelaty from, simply put, do minor exercise things
every 3-4 hours and you won't suffer any lose.
(Note: Wisdom is an exception. It stops gaining at 18 and will never 
decrease.)
(Your stats must be at 10 before your body can accept training, normal
move trainers can aid in raising your stats to 10.)
(help limit for details about body limits.)

0 THIEF THIEVES~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society.  The skills of the thief reflect his way
of life, namely sneaking in the dark, picking locks, and attacking from
behind with deadly backstabs.  Thieves have always had a bad reputation
so don't be suprised if you are always under suspicion.  Thieves start off
fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and circle they soon
become dangerous foes.  A thief is always usefull when there is a lock
that needs opening or an item that needs to be stolen.

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/force/move regeneration, power

Of these timers, the hp/force/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

101 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax: unfoldarea <area filename>

This command will load up an area file.

NOTE: It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already loaded,
      or one that has not been tested.
~

0 UPGRADE SHIPUPGRADE~
When one purchases a ship there can be some upgrades 
they themselves can purchase for it. Clan ships can only 
purchase upgrades through the leader, although the Clan 
Immortal is allowed to add more rules to that.
 
1 Million Dollars:
Renaming a Ship (Class Data can not be removed however) 
Changing a description to a room (No lewdness)
 
5 Million Dollars:
Changing the Ships Build (EG moving the rooms around in 
a different order, but not actually adding or subtracting the 
room total)
 
10 Million Dollars:
Adding a Door to a Room (Limit of 1 per ship)
 
30 Million Dollars:
Adding a Prog (Program) to a room. (EG when you walk 
into a room it may do this: "A Hologram lights up and a 
picture of young girl appears. A young girl says 'I am ready 
for an adventure!") (The Program can't force players out of 
your ship or prevent it from being hijacked!)
 
Note: Please don't ask for ship's stat upgrades, eg Hull, weapons, speed etc.
It isn't going to happen, and doing so is just wasting Immortals time!
~

1 USE ACTIVATE~
.
Syntax : Use (item)
 
Quite obviously lets you use an item.
~

101 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

101 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

0 VALENTINE VALENTINEQUEST~

ISSP is a pack of lying bastards. I know the truth now
ISSP set Diana and me up to die, but I didn't die. Now I 
am going to expose ISSP. They tried to make a deal with 
RDS for ...(unreadable) My love Diana, I may die but I 
swear to you that your blood shall go avenged. Please 
guide me. My plan is simple, yet  (the letter is stained 
from tears and the ink ran)ISSP has now become just 
as bad as the groups we had once fought against. 
February 14 please don't get on the ISSP's Casino ship. I 
may even die from this stunt. Joseph, please leave ISSP 
as fast as you can. A new world has arisen, corrupting the 
old world.
 
Your Former-ISSP Friend,
Michael

~

104 VENUS SAVE~
~

0 VICTORY~
During a war, if a clan can settle things peacefully then that is the best
way outside of total war. The MUD calculates how a clan is winning the war
in a variety of ways, which is a not fully known. When the victory is met,
the clan who wins is echoed to the entire MUD and it is logged. Then, the
winning clan's leader and losing clan's leader must come together at a
summit, taking place shortly after the war's over, where the winning clan
may state what they want because of their victory. An Immortal will be
present to observe this and make sure the losing side gives into demands
and also makes sure the winner doesn't get wild with what they want.

voting with 'note vote <number> open'.  All those who can read the
board may then vote on the issue in the note with 'note vote <number>
yes/no/abstain'. The author may close the voting; the syntax for that
should be clear enough.
 
Note list will show whether a note is not a voting note, open to voting
or closed to voting.  The character that separates the author and the
recipient in 'note list' will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.
~

101 VSEARCH~
Syntax:  vsearch <vnum of target object>
 
Returns all instances of the target object presently in the game, as

inappropriate subject matter.

back.

0 WHINE~
As a courtesy to all players and Immortals there are these rules:
No whining on OOC, period.
If you whine, you can expect 1 to 2 hours of silence and repeat offenders
can face up to 4 hours in hell or worse. If you have a short temper or
like to 'bitch and moan' please turn off any channels when you feel in
the mood to unload on a channel. It will save a lot of people a lot of trouble.
Some examples of whining:
"Fuck! I can't believe you fucking killed me!"
"You bitch! That is my weapon!"
"This code sucks!"
"Why can't I fucking level to the next damn level!"
Etc, etc.
However, we still encourage you to post ideas and disagree with what we code
in or build in, but we ask (and require) you to express you opinions in
a forum we can moderate and view so that we can decide on any changes.
The appropriate place for this is Global Board 2(GB 2, help gboard and
help gnote for details). Thank you for compling with our rules! We also
remind you that when you make your character you agree to follow all the rules
we set forth, if you do not wish to comply with them, please type suicide
and your password. Thank you for playing!

0 WTS~
The White Tiger Syndicate was founded by Gatz Seijuro  in 2070  originally
as a response to ISSP's corrupt dealings.  Gatz believed  that to destroy
ISSP, he needed the perfect organization. Once this clan had reached it's
height, there was a series of wars between the righteous WTS and the
wicked criminals of the Red Dragons. It was a long period of time where
neither clan could gain much superiority over the other. However, upon
Sayaka's fall, her personal bodyguard, Hayden took command. Hayden, being
one of the greatest killers in the universe now leads the White Tigers in
a much different fashion. The Tigers are no less corrupted, nor any less
evil than any other clan. Victory by any means necessary is the only goal
for this once holy group of crusaders.
