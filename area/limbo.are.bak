&RThe Intra Solar System Police Galactic Jail: Men's Wing&w~
The dark jail cell has some faint light filter in from the cold bars which
block the outside world out. The dull cement floor is cold and the jail is
often cold at night. The metal bars are all controlled by a central room
which is fair away from the cells. The dirty beds are unkept and filled
with various bed bugs. The walls were built to keep prisoners from
escaping, and have little of anything to interest the tired eyes of weary
inmates. The sink and toilet are huddled together in the back and offer
little to no privacy.

&RVenus Hospital&w~
The warm Venutian temperture allows for the window in the ward to remain
open. A gently sea breeze clips against the white curtains and makes the
wood piece hit the wall, creating an occasional click sound. The bed they
keep patients in is a traditional hospital bed with a metal frame, built
to allow easy access to places patients on and off the bed by hospital
attendants. A heart monitor is kept in place perminently by all the beds
just in case a patient comes in at a critical condition.     The gentle
beeps are slightly muffeled by the cocktail of drugs Venus is famous for
giving. Soukai Corporation pays for the hospital to accept all medical
patients who come in, so there is no room charge or hospital fees placed
on patients or their families.

The Arena~
You stand in the direct center of the Arena.  Blood pools around your
feet, and you almost slip in this morbid mess.  The stench of death
surrounds you, momentarily blocking from your mind the realization
that you could be attacked from any conceivable direction.  Spinning
slowly about, you realize the poor tactical position you hold.

The Halls of Combat~
You stand in a massive hallway before the great Arena.  Cheers and jeers
from the assembled throngs rise and fall through the corridors.  Lounging
around the hall with you are several other individuals awaiting their own
chance at glory, honor, and spoils beyond the great doors.  The Arena is
dangerous, though, and battles are often to the death.  Once you leave
this room, there is no turning back.....

First Combatant's Chamber~
You stand in a long hallway leading out into the Arena proper.  About
